        <center><p>Erobb221, real name Eric Lamont Robbins III Jr. (also known as: Emoney, Lemon, Borby, Rick, Wonky, Todd) is a Twitch Just Chatting streamer with a deformed head, 1-and-a-half eyes, and a severe lack of hair. He streams on Twitch to a devoted ~2000 viewers that enjoy bantering with the Goomba as he streams regularly with a scamming mindset, attaining money and funds from foolish Erobbers and egregious Wonk Gang members every stream.

            Borby first got his start on Twitch by Dareon telling him to stream when Lamont didn't know what to stream at the time. Since he did not have much leverage back then, he got the wise idea to stream while drunk and threatening to end stream if people didn't donate to him.
            
            Now Todd's content has deteriorated into a mess of streams, wondering if he'll have the mental fortitude to pick up a new story game and add it to the list of games he has beaten. Pain
            
            Borbicus Lamonticus the 3rd, is a Goomba. A Goomba that is entertaining, or rather lets his viewers make fun of him. Not one stream goes by without a '4Weird', 'OMEGALUL' or Twitch Chat & limebot221 imitating Monty's mannerisms with variations of the 'Lime' emote.</p></center>
